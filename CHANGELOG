### DBUS-ADC changelog
---

__Version 1.00__
 - Started development on gps_dbus project and make the first initial working version for the dbus-adc project

__Version 1.01__
 - First version for hardware version 2
 - First functioning (but not verified) version

__Version 1.10__
NOTE: This version still works on a branch of velib! Which needs to be fixed before making this part of an official bbb image.

 - Add sensor function and status fields. 
  - Function field will determine how the analog pin should function. 
   - When function field = no_function the relevant sensor dbus service will be disconnected.
  - Status field indecates the status of the sensor.
   - When sensor status is not o.k. invalidate its value (and publish invalid value)

 - Updated submodule (velib on branch WIP_add_settings) to include the generated produc numbers in products.h.
Publish the correct product name and ID of the sensor to dbus service.

__Version 1.11__
NOTE: This version was created towards making an official bbb image with velib on master branch

 - velib is in master branch
 - Changed the Analog Inputs Function indexings to match the physical connector indexing
 - Add temperature sensor types 
  - Enum:
    0- battery
    1- refrigerator
    2- other

__Version 1.12__
 - Fix temperature and tank level sensor bugs
 - Tank level sensor- when status not o.k. remaning value is 0 instead of unknown
 - Temperature sensor- 
  - when status not o.k. last value is shown
  - showing -200 degrees C when connected in reverse polarity
  - minimum temperature should be -20 degrees C (bellow that temperature is unknown)
  - should try to detect connection in revers polarity
 - Change Connection item value (string) in the Device Page 
  - For tank lvel sensor- Tank lvel sensor input 1/2/3
  - For temperature sensor- Temperature sensor 1/2 
 - Invalidate sensor output data when sensor status is not OK.

__Version 1.13__
 - Fix tank level sensor disconnection detection.
  - When the tank level sensor is being disconnected the pin voltage is clambed at v > ~1.4. therefore the voltage threshold for disconnection detection was changed from 1.3v to 1.4v


__Version 1.14__
 - Fixed swapped tank level standard (American <-> European)
   https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/issues/157
 - Fixed bug in potential divider voltage calculation (this bug never caused problems because of
   the way the function was called).
 - Fixed code style issues
 - Translate the enums used on the D-Bus to strings instead of showing integral values.
