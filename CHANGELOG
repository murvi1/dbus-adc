official bbb image.

Changes:
Add sensor function and status fields. 
	- Function field will determine how the analog pin should function. 
		* When function field = no_function the relevant sensor dbus service will be disconnected.
	- Status field indecates the status of the sensor.
		* When sensor status is not o.k. invalidate its value (and publish invalid value)

Publish the correct product name and ID of the sensor to dbus service.
