Version 1.00
============
Started development on gps_dbus project and make the first initial working version for the dbus-adc project


Version 1.01
============
First version for hardware version 2
First functioning (but not verified) version


Version 1.10
============
NOTE: This version still works on a branch of velib! Which needs to be fixed before making this part of an
official bbb image.

Changes:
Add sensor function and status fields. 
	- Function field will determine how the analog pin should function. 
		* When function field = no_function the relevant sensor dbus service will be disconnected.
	- Status field indecates the status of the sensor.
		* When sensor status is not o.k. invalidate its value (and publish invalid value)

Updated submodule (velib on branch WIP_add_settings) to include the generated produc numbers in products.h.
Publish the correct product name and ID of the sensor to dbus service.
