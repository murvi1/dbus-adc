Version 1.00
============
Started development on gps_dbus project and make the first initial working version for the dbus-adc project


Version 1.01
============
First version for hardware version 2
First functioning (but not verified) version


Version 1.10
============
NOTE: This version still works on a branch of velib! Which needs to be fixed before making this part of an
official bbb image.

Changes:
Add sensor function and status fields. 
	- Function field will determine how the analog pin should function. 
		* When function field = no_function the relevant sensor dbus service will be disconnected.
	- Status field indecates the status of the sensor.
		* When sensor status is not o.k. invalidate its value (and publish invalid value)

Updated submodule (velib on branch WIP_add_settings) to include the generated produc numbers in products.h.
Publish the correct product name and ID of the sensor to dbus service.

Version 1.11
============
NOTE: This version was created towards making an official bbb image with velib on master branch


Changes:
velib is in master branch
Changed the Analog Inputs Function indexings to match the physical connector indexing
Add temperature sensor types
    
    Enum:
    0- battery
    1- refrigerator
    2- other

Version 1.12
============
    Fix temperature and tank level sensor bugs
    
    Tank level sensor- when status not o.k. remaning value is 0 instead of unknown
    Temperature sensor- 1. when status not o.k. last value is shown
                        2. showing -200 degrees C when connected in reverse polarity
                        3. minimum temperature should be -20 degrees C (bellow that temperature is unknown)
                        4. should try to detect connection in revers polarity
    
    Change Connection item value (string) in the Device Page
    
    For tank lvel sensor- Tank lvel sensor input 1/2/3
    For temperature sensor- Temperature sensor 1/2
    
    Invalidate sensor output data when sensor status is not OK.
